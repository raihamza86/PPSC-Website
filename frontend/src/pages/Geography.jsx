        Geography is a crucial subject in PPSC, FPSC, and other competitive exams because it helps candidates
        understand the physical and political aspects of the world, which are essential for administrative roles. Many
        exams include geography-related questions covering physical geography (landforms, climate, natural disasters),
        human geography (population, urbanization, industries), and Pakistan’s geography (rivers, mountains, provinces, and
        resources). This knowledge is vital for civil servants and government officials as they often deal with issues
        like environmental management, urban planning, and resource distribution.

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-justify text-base leading-relaxed font-opensans">
        Furthermore, geography is directly linked to current affairs, as many national and international issues—such as
        climate change, geopolitics, and economic geography—impact government policies. Candidates who have a strong grasp
        of geography can perform better in General Knowledge, Pakistan Studies, and even interview rounds, making it an
        essential subject for success in competitive exams.
